# GodotUtils
A compilation of Godot scripts I wrote.
## Easing
A C# implementation of some easing functions from https://easings.net.
## Extension Methods
Some common extension methods I tend to use in my games.
## LevelGenerator
A custom LDtk importer, designed to generate 3D levels.
## Pathfinder
A basic A\* implementation. Not very efficient, but quicker to set up alongside LevelGenerator than the built-in one.
## SceneController
A generic scene loader, with a fade in/out effect between scenes.
